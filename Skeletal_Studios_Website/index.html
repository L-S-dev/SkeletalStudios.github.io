			<h1>Skeletal Studios</h1>
			<p>
				Skeletal Studios is an independent passion-driven development effort founded and run by L.S. It focuses on experimenting, learning, and building original software and games from the ground up.
			</p>
			<p>
				What is Skeletal Studios?
			</p>
			<p>
				Skeletal Studios is currently a solo project developed in free time, centered around programming-focused creativity. The work primarily involves creating a fully Java-based game engine and developing games built entirely on custom-written systems rather than pre-made frameworks.
			<p>
				The goal of Skeletal Studios is not rapid production or commercial output, but long-term growth, technical understanding, and the freedom to experiment with ideas that may not fit traditional studio pipelines.
